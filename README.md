# Roll_Dice_Game one dice game for one or two players.

#  Rules :
# The game includes 1 or 2 players on a single screen.
#  Each player has a temporary score (current) and an overall score.
#  At each turn, the player has his ROUND initialized to 0 and can roll a die as many times as he wishes. THE
#  result of a throw is added to current.
# During his turn, the player can decide at any time to:
#  - Click on the “Hold” option, which sends the points of the current to the GLOBAL. It will then be the
#  other player's turn.
#  - Roll the dice. If he rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost and his turn ends.
#  The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
